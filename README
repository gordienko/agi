This library comes with absolutely no warranty.

agi is a library to write AGI scripts in ruby language for Asterisk. agi does not depend of Asterisk Manager.
There have a very simple AGI script in example/call_log.rb.
I couldn't write any tutorial for agi and I am not good at it, if anybody want to give me a hand on writing documentation and tutorial, would be greatly appreciated.

Here are a sites that may help to know more about agi
http://agi.rubyforge.org           (agi homepage)

Feel free to send me email, if you don't find any answer related to agi

Thank you,
